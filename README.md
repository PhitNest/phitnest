### Backend

In order for the app to function properly, you need to connect to the backend.

If you have not already, clone the backend repo: [PhitNest-API](https://github.com/PhitNest/phitnest-api)

follow the instructions in the `README.md` to run the backend.

### .env

In order for the app to function properly, you need to configure the environment variables.

Create a file named `.env` in your flutter project directory. Copy the contents of either `.env.example.prod`, `.env.example.android`, or `.env.example.ios` into the new file. Then you are ready to run the app.
